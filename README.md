### ## ü§î Why `react-n-design`?

Tired of the same flat UI components? `react-n-design` offers a fresh, tactile, and visually appealing alternative. Based on the principles of **Neomorphism**, our components use soft shadows and highlights to create an illusion of depth, making your UI feel like it's extruding from the background. It's modern, clean, and a joy to interact with.

---

### ## ‚ú® Features

* **Beautiful Design:** Soft, modern UI based on Neomorphism.
* **Highly Customizable:** Components come with a rich set of props for easy customization.
* **Fully Typed:** Written entirely in **TypeScript** for a superb developer experience.
* **Lightweight & Performant:** Optimized for a small bundle size with tree-shaking support.
* **Animated & Accessible:** Fluid animations powered by `framer-motion` and a focus on accessibility.
* **Well Documented:** Explore every component interactively with Storybook.

### ## üöÄ Installation

`react-n-design` has peer dependencies on `react` and `styled-components`.

### ## üíª Quick Start

To start using the components, wrap your application's root with the `ThemeProvider`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, theme } from 'react-n-design';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <div style={{ background: theme.colors.background, padding: '2rem' }}>
      <Card>
        <h3>Welcome to react-n-design!</h3>
        <p>This is a card component containing a button.</p>
        <Button 
          leftIcon="üéâ" 
          onClick={() => alert('Welcome!')}
        >
          Get Started
        </Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```
