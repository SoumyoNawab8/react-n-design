# Usage Guide

This guide covers how to install and efficiently use the `react-n-design` component library in your project.

## Installation

`react-n-design` has peer dependencies on `react` and `styled-components`.

```bash
npm install react-n-design styled-components
```

## Basic Setup

To start using the components, wrap your application's root with our `AppThemeProvider` to enable theming.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AppThemeProvider } from 'react-n-design/context';
import { MainApp } from './MainApp'; // Your application's main component

const App = () => (
  <AppThemeProvider>
    <MainApp />
  </AppThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## Tree Shaking & Performance

`react-n-design` is optimized for performance and supports tree shaking out of the box. For the best possible bundle size, you can import components directly.

### Standard Import (Good)
Your bundler will do its best to remove unused components.

```jsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from 'react-n-design';
```

### Direct Import (Best Performance)
This method guarantees that only the specific component's code is included in your final bundle.

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-n-design/components/Button';
import { Card } from 'react-n-design/components/Card';
import { Input } from 'react-n-design/components/Input';
```
```
